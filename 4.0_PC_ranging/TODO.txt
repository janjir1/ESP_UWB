TODO:

have to:
C fix watchdog - anchor X tag
X fix number of devices > 3
fix number of deices < 2
do sdkconfig
loop to task

should:
X better timing for more data and less latency
X automaticly get ESP_long_adrr from something device specific
X all anchors start sending to PC at roughlz same time, add device specific latency for safer wifi transfer (POLL sends this information)

would be cool to:
different way of getting wifi credantials (not hardcoded)
