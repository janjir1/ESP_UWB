TODO:

have to:
fix delay(1) - is there on anchor to fight watchdog
X fix number of devices > 3
fix number of deices < 2
do sdkconfig

should:
X better timing for more data and less latency
X automaticly get ESP_long_adrr from something device specific
all anchors start sending to PC at roughlz same time, add device specific latency for safer wifi transfer (POLL sends this information)

would be cool to:
different way of getting wifi credantials (not hardcoded)
